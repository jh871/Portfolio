## Description

This is a single-page application built with React. The app features pages giving an introduction to me, a list of my skills, projects I have worked on and some contact information. 


-------
## Installation / Usage

This app can viewed in browser on desktop or mobile.


-------
## Development

This app was created with create-react-app, and built with JSX JavaScript. It was styled using Mui core components and CSS including some media queries, along with Google Fonts. Navigation is implemented using React Router. It is deployed on Netlify. I also used pre-deployment checks on each pull request on GitHub to stop any issues interfering with deployment.



-------
## Future Development

I would like to learn Framer Motion to add some animation - transitions on page changes might be nice. 

I would like to restyle the skills page to look more interesting or be interactive - same with the contact info page. The contact info page could also benefit from a contact form.

I originally wanted each individual project to open in a modal but had trouble getting this to work so could take another run at this sometime.

I would like to replace using Create React App with using NextJs.
